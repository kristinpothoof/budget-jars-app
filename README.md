# Budget Jars App
This is the proof-of-concept demo for a web-based app for managing a simple personal budget.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (other tools to be used in final version)

First, I built the general structure for the layout, then used UIkit and some custom CSS for styling. Then, I programmed the simple functionalities of the interface. After that, I set up the dynamic functionality that allows users to add their own items to the list with their own budget amounts. The dynamic table was the most difficult part, since each section had to not only display the user input, but it had to be interactive, and responsive to dynamic user updates. 

## Optimizations
Shortened and streamlined JS file using OOP best practices. Planned iterations of the app include back-end user data management and more efficient API. Other features of the app to be added include a "Transactions" panel, a graphical representation of the budget amounts, and additional options on the user interface.

## Lessons Learned:

This project strengthened my understanding of the DOM API and how to set up functions to control what type of data is to be expected for the inputs and outputs.
